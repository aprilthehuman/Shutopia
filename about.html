      <p>　　As an international student, I enrolled in <b>UC Irvine's ESL Program</b> for six months to challenge myself and improve my English skills. This experience provided me with opportunities to interact with peers from diverse backgrounds, navigate everyday challenges, and explore new places.

Additionally, as a <b>teaching assistant in the MBA program</b>, I discovered the importance of sincerity and diligence in building strong relationships with students and colleagues.</p>
